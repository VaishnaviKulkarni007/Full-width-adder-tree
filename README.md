# Full-width-adder-tree

*week1:
  DATA WIDTH- 8 inputs with 8 bit data width 
  Description: 
  In the first stage of the adder tree, consist of four two input adders ( 8 bit inputs) and 
  provides output of 9 bits (carry). These four outputs are the inputs for stage 2 of the 
  adder tree, where we use two adders (9bit input) to provide outputs of 10bits(carry) 
  and finally this is summed in a 10 bit adder to provide a 11 bit output 
  This design is the basis for DSP applications.
